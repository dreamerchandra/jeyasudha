# Calculating methods
`Material cash` isn't considered for calculating overall due
`Material credit` and `due credit` will increase overall due
`due cash` will decrease overall due
Hence formulae 
`overall due = material-credit + due-credit - due-cash`

## Scenario 1
// 5,000 material cash
// 10,000 material credit
// 2,000 due cash
// 2,000 due credit
// 10,000 due cash
overall due = 10000(material credit)-2,000(due cash)+2000(due credit)-10,000(due cash) = 0
